A class acts as a blueprint for creating these objects, while an object is an instance of that class, representing a specific entity with its own data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP promotes code reusability and maintainability by grouping related data and functions together, using key principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n"

        "   --- Abstraction and encapsulation are two distinct but complementary concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), including in Python.\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential functionalities to the user. This simplification allows for easier interaction with objects and promotes a clear separation between the interface and its underlying implementation. In Python, abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes and methods, which define a blueprint for subclasses to implement specific functionalities.\n",
        "Encapsulation, on the other hand, deals with bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. It emphasizes data hiding and controlled access to an object's internal state. This means that an object's data is protected from direct external modification and can only be accessed or manipulated through the defined methods of the class. In Python, encapsulation is achieved by convention through naming conventions (e.g., using a single leading underscore for \"protected\" attributes and a double leading underscore for \"private\" attributes) and by providing getter and setter methods to control access to data."
