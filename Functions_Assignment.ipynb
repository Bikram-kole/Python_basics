        "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "Values are generated only when requested, on-demand. This \"lazy\" approach means computation is performed only when necessary, which can lead to performance improvements for certain operations, as resources are not consumed to generate values that may never be used.\n",
        "State Preservation:\n",
        "Unlike regular functions that lose their state upon returning, generators maintain their state between successive yield calls. This allows them to resume execution from where they left off, making them suitable for iterative processes that require remembering previous states.\n",
        "Pipelining and Data Processing:\n",
        "Generators can be chained together to create efficient data processing pipelines. Each generator in the chain can perform a specific transformation on the data before passing it to the next stage, enabling modular and memory-efficient data manipulation.\n",
        "Handling Infinite Sequences:\n",
